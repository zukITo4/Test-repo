When a humble bard graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia, along came this song
From when the White Wolf fought a silver-tongued devil
His army of elves at his hooves did they revel
They came after me with masterful deceit
Broke down my lute and they kicked in my teeth
While the Devil's horns minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher, "He can't be bleat"
